The project aims to transform the recruitment process by implementing an automated text mining technology that efficiently categorizes resumes into specific job segments. This innovative program intends to enhance applicant-job matching, significantly reduce the time and resources currently allocated to manual resume screening, and elevate the overall candidate job search experience. 
This is a collaborative project among five members and the data was extracted from PDFs text, followed by rigorous cleaning, preparation, and manual data labeling to prepare it for model training.
